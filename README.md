# Greedy-approach-and-tree-ds
This repository includes key problems on Greedy algorithms and Tree data structures. Greedy solves optimization problems by choosing the best local option. Trees (binary, BST, traversal, etc.) cover hierarchical data handling. Ideal for interview prep with clean, beginner-friendly code.
